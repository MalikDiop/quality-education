### “A good education is essential to a child’s economic future, and where you can afford to live has a lot to do with whether your child gets that education,” Rothwell said. “In most metro areas, the only way to attend high-scoring schools is to live in an expensive neighborhood. This makes it very difficult for children born at the bottom to rise to the top.”
